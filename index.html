      <h4>Joshua Daniel</h4>
      <img id="josh" class="col s4" src="images/Joshua Daniel 2.jpg">
      <p class="font" class="col s5" >I am a Creative technologist eager to approach challenges in
        pursuit of a thirst for self improvement and motivated by the possibilities
        of integrating technology to assist in the lifestyle of others. An observant
        collaborator whose active participation values the perspective of colleagues
        and improves productivity. I'm an enthusiatic college graduate that has set my eyes on a new career path.
        Over the years, like so many others, I immersed myself in technology during its rapid
        growth. I have done everything from playing video games, taking computer classes,
        to using tech as a major resource in every day life. I always believed that the birth
        of technology and its growth was a very fascinating phenomenon. Growing more curious
        about how the world wide web existed and its inner workings, I decided that reading
        about it would only take me so far. I decided to enroll in the Web Development
        Immersive Remote class to be part of the revolution that is technology.
        Immersing myself in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ruby, and SQL has been
        quite the adventure. Going forward, I plan to expand my understanding of the
        languages and learn new ones.

    <h4>Tic Tac Toe</h4>
    <p class="col s6">I developed an awesome Tic Tac Toe that reminds you of nothing but great times on the beach. My objective was to make the game functional, so I spent the majority of my time programming it in JavaScript. Keeping in mind the user experience,
      I added CSS to make things pop. While the structure is somewhat basic, I still tinker with it to adjust the flow.‚Äù</p>

  <h4>Box it up!!</h4>
  <p class="col s6">I worked in a team to create my first Ruby on Rails application.  The two main resources for this application were boxs and items.  I worked on completing a full CRUD resources for the items portion of the project while my partner completed the other.
  allthough we made it quite far in the project, we ran into a few issues. Since the creation of the project we have fixed some linking problems between the two resources but it can still use many edits. </p>
