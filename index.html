  <h4>About </h4>

  <p>I'm an enthusiatic college graduate that has set my eyes on a new career path. Over the years, like so many others, I immersed myself in technology during its rapid growth. I have done everything from playing video games, taking computer classes, to using tech as a major resource in every day life. I always believed that the birth of technology and its growth was a very fascinating phenomenon. Growing more curious about how the world wide web existed and its inner workings, I decided that reading about it would only take me so far. I decided to enroll in the Web Development Immersive Remote class to be part of the revolution that is technology. Immersing myself in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ruby, and SQL has been quite the adventure. Going forward, I plan to expand my understanding of the languages and learn new ones.</p>
